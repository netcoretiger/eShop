# eShop with Angular / Asp.net Core

## The main purpose of eShop

The main purpose of
the online store is to present users with a catalog of the products on
sale. This catalog will provide the ability to search for text, as well as
apply simple filters, such as product category. Users may insert the
selected products in the cart and then proceed to checkout and
submission of their order.
The web store will also enable administrators to modify the product
catalog, by adding / editing / deleting products. Administrators will
also be able to view submitted orders.
The web store will be open to anonymous users to browse through the
catalog. Users will need to register in order to proceed with their
purchase. Admin pages will be available only to authorized users.
In order to avoid unneeded complexity and at the same time highlight
the important issues of Angular development, the web app will have a
simple design. For instance, only the product name and its short
description will be maintained, along with the product photo and
price. Furthermore, we will not use a lot of CSS in this course, but
Bootstrap will be employed in order to attain a simple but elegant
design.
In contrast to the store design, its functionality will be far from
rudimentary. It is the aim of the tutorial to use as many important
capabilities of the Angular framework as possible. For instance,
pagination will be used for the catalog main page and filters will
appear as pop-up windows. Communication with the backend API
will be authenticated via JSON Web Tokens (JWT). Moreover, routing
and validation functionality will be used throughout the project.
On the backend side, the API will follow a REST-like approach, using
the ASP.NET Core Web API functionality. As far as persistence is
concerned, the Entity Framework (EF) code-first approach will be
used, where the database tables are created by code, in a series of
migrations.
